## Hard-copy terminals

A hard-copy terminal is a terminal which prints the output on paper. Although such terminals where outdated in the early 80's, simple UART terminals does not always support arbritary cursor movement. The cursor only move forwards, or in best case it supports going backwards on the current line. As such they reseble hard-copy terminals.

The output of Amon is designed to be compatible with such limited terminals, in order for it so be as portable as possible.
